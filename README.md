# clean-commerce
A project developed in Rodrigo Branas' Clean Architecure course. I'm using this project to improve my software design skills applying concepts like clean code, clean architecture, DDD, TDD, etc.

## Technologies
I'm using javascript/typescript as main language and as project grows I'll be inserting other technologies like a test runner, SGBD, REST API library.

## Running
To execute project first install all dependencies via NPM by running the following command at project's root folder:

```
npm install 
```

And execute the start script:
```
npm run start
```
